  <h3>Services</h3>
  <p>Quantum Web Cafe offers a wide range of services, many of which have been bought in as a result of customer feedback over the years. If you'd like to comment or make a suggestion or our services, you can do so on our Facebook page, or you can contact us directly.</p>
  <br>

  <h3>General PC and Internet Use</h3>
  <p>PCs are available, without the need to book in advance, all day. Our highest hourly rate works out to be £3.00 and you only pay for the time you actually use. So, if you're less than an hour, it'll be less than £3.00. For example, 30 minutes would be £1.50. There’s a minimum charge of £1.00 which buys you up to 20 mins. There are also a range of versatile discount schemes available that can reduce the price to as low as £1.66 an hour. Click here for details.
  <br>
  <br>
  Remember, in our cafe you can use a PC as if it was your own without limitation, restriction or even annoying timer software. You can even charge your mobile at no extra cost while using our PCs! Click here for details about our fast and extensive internet access, what our PC's look like and what’s on them.

  <h3>Gaming and Leisure Use</h3>
  <p>The same price structure applies to Gaming as above, and in some stores the games PCs are in their own games zone to allow you to make as much noise as you like! There are also a number of discount schemes available for regular, semi regular or long session users, click here for details.

  Last update: April 2017 when there were approximately 100 games on each PC including FPS (First Person Shooters, such as Left for Dead 2), RTS (Real Time Strategy such as Age of Empires), MMORG (Massively Multilayer On-line Role playing Games, such as World of Warcraft, League of Legends, WarThunder etc), and Racing genres. Oh, and Solitaire.
