	    <h2>Our Story</h2>
	    <p>Welcome to Takoyaki Cafe, the PH's longest running Internet Cafe and Games Zone</p>
	    <p>We've been around a very long time! The Reading cafe opened in 1999, although our Guildford branch opened a few years previously in 1996, just as the internet was getting started in the main stream. We sold our Guildford store some years ago but the new owners closed it down in 2013, so this store is now the longest surviving 'proper' internet cafe and games zone in the country. </p>
	    <p>We're also a bit different from any other cafe you may have been to ... </p>
	    <p>Apart from always having a clean, bright and professional environment for our customers to work and play, we've always prided ourselves on one thing: you can use our computers as if they are your own. </p>
